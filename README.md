cpp11-study
===========

This code repository is just used to track my learning and practices on the **C++11** features and languages. Here is a quick list of the examples added to this code base:

- for-each.cpp - For the `foreach` and *range based for* feature   
- cond.cpp - For concurrency features and **lambda**   
- async.cpp - Concurrency features, future, launch policy, etc  
- initializer-list.cpp - For **initializer list** feature and **uniform initialization**   
- type-interface.cpp - For `auto` and `decltype` 
- lambda.cpp - For **lambda** function and **closure**
